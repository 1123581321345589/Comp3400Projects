# README for IPC

In this assignment, you'll be practicing using IPC.

Similar to the first assignment, either download the initial source files using github or download the ZIP file using
Firefox into your Ubuntu environment.

Once the repository is downloaded on your system, go through each level one by one.

READMEs are moved into their respective directories:

- level1_fork/README.md
- level2_exec/README.md
- level3_pipe/README.md

**PLEASE** read them carefully as I have included additional information regarding the system calls. There are many
minute details of the system calls that I have not bothered during the lecture (otherwise it'll get even more dry!) that
are very important for successfully completing the project.

## Level 3

Lastly, we'll be using the pipe() system call.
