A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell
Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on
Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating
system.[5] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one
of the most widely used programming languages,[6][7] with C compilers from
various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures
and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C)
and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
